This small library is a set of helper functions to write emails more
effectively.  Currently it is WiP, but quite a few functions here are
already useful.  Note: many things are assumed, like that ">" is the
quotation prefix, or that quite a few strings are in Polish, etc.
(When the code matures, I'll move such things to my own =init.el=.)
Any comments welcome.  The code is released under GPL v2 or later.
